# SMASHING MAGAZINE PAGE CLONE

The goal of this project is to build a heatmap of the Smashing magazine website

> I learned to size and position the page using correct semantic HTML elements appropriately.

> Correctly setting up the navigation bar.

> Played around with media queries to work a bit on the site responsiveness even though the original isn't.
